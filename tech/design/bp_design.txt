1. Block Producing Node
   This will be the main node that eosnewyork.io uses to produce blocks.  
   a. Specifications:
      - OS: Ubuntu 17.10
      - vCPU: 8
      - RAM: 256 - 512
      - Storage: 
        - 512GB SSD (blocks)
        - 1TB HDD for IPFS
      - Network: 1 Gbps (scaling as necessary)
   b. Location:
      We will be running our initial producing node in the AWS cloud because 
      we believe one of the core responsibilites of a BP to stay agile and 
      expand at the speed the blockchain requires.
   c. Security:
      We plan on locking this node down using a variety of custom software
      stacks, built-in unix tools, and industry standards.  As this is the 
      flagship node security is obviously of the utmost importance.  We also 
      plan on working with a couple of potential BPs and various security 
      professionals to produce a white paper on securing a producing node.
